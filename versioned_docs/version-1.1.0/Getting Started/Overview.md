# Overview

**Allxon Octo SDK** establishes an extensible architecture on edge devices with Allxon Agent and device plugins. The Agent handles the communication between device plugins and Allxon Cloud. The device management application is programmed as one such device plugin that connects and controls the hardware or software modules of edge devices. By working with the Agent, information or configuration of device plugins can be managed on Allxon Portal.
